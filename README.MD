AI Capstone Project – Beginner’s Toolkit with GenAI

# JavaBot 🤖

JavaBot is a beginner-friendly **command-line chatbot built in Java** as part of an AI-powered learning toolkit project.
Instead of a traditional “Hello World,” this project uses conversational interaction to explore core Java fundamentals.

## Project Objective

🎯 The goal of this project is to demonstrate how generative AI can be used to quickly learn a new technology, scaffold a working application, and document the learning process clearly so others can replicate it.
